# Second IASA2 Retrospective

## Reason for This Document

BCP 101 / RFC 8711 specifies a requirement to conduct a [three-year retrospective](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-three-year-assessment) of the IETF Administrative Support Activity version 2.0 (IASA2). That was completed in 2021 (https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf), and the first recommendation was that these should occur every three years (see below). 

This is the second IASA2 retrospective, and future retrospectives should be published in 2027, 2030, 2033, and so on every three years. 

> The IETF LLC should conduct a regular assessment of the IASA structure and
   IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final
   IETF meeting of each of those years. Based on this IASA2 retrospective being
   completed in 2021, the next IASA assessments should occur in 2024, 2027,
   2030, 2033, and so on.
> 
> The point of performing a regular assessment is that the IETF's way of
   working and its needs will continue to evolve, while the external environment
   will also change. Thus, periodically checking in to see whether there are
   structural, process, financial, operational, legal, or other administrative
   adaptations are needed makes sense. As well, by making small changes on an
   incremental basis, the risks associated with each change is likely to be
   smaller because the changes are correspondingly smaller, and there is a
   regular check-in every three years at which point the IETF can assess the
   effectiveness of any change so that modest course corrections can be made.
   Finally, keeping up with internal and external changes may also potentially
   help the IETF avoid large once-a-decade administrative structure changes that
   are multi-year efforts like IASA2 - and this is not only a time-saver but
   also lets IETF leaders and participants remain more focused on the core
   standards work of the IETF.
> 
> In addition, as the IETF evolves how the organization wishes to work and meet
   in a post-COVID world, such as potentially changing meeting frequency,
   reducing in-person venue size requirements, shifting to hybrid meetings, and
   so on, the IETF LLC will need to adapt to provide the necessary
   administrative, operational, legal, financial, and other support to meet the
   changing needs of the IETF.

# Note on Form 

In the first IASA2 retrospective, we reviewed a list of 62 requirments. Most of those were met, so in order to reduce the 
length of this document and focus on what has changed since 2021, we will not reproduce the full list here. The original IASA2 retrospective is available at [https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf).

# Review of Key Issues, Requirements and Responsibilities

## Sponsorships and Donations to the IETF LLC

1.A. **Requirement:** Fundraising. The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.

1.B. **Requirement**: Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of
    the financial support for the IETF. Within the general bounds noted in
    Section 7.8, the IETF LLC is responsible for fundraising activities in order
    to establish, maintain, and grow a strong foundation of donation revenues.
    This can and does include both direct financial contributions as well as
    in-kind contributions, such as equipment, software licenses, and services.

    Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey to
    sponsors and donors any special oversight or direct influence over the
    IETF's technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC. This
    helps ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from whom
    funds are raised, and so helps to maintain an open and consensus-based IETF
    standards process.

    To the extent that the IETF LLC needs to undertake any significant special
    projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC may need to fund-raise distinctly for
    those special projects. As a result, the IETF LLC may conduct fundraising to
    support the IETF in general as well as one or more special fundraising
    efforts (which may also be accounted for distinctly and be held in a
    separate bank account or investment, as needed).

1.C. **Requirement**: Support a Re-Envisioned Funding Model: Provide the staff
    support and resources needed to adapt the funding model of the IETF to
    changes in the industry, participation, and expenses.  The structure should
    also allow for and be able to support new funding streams or changes to the
    proportion of funds from various Sources.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; Needs Improvement

   **Comments:** This remains a primary focus of the IETF LLC. Sponsorship income has been strong and has grown with our modernisation of our sponsorship offerings, but is at risk as companies reduce their spending. Donations to the IETF Endowment have been disappointing, but changes in approach and staffing have been made. Additional attention and prioritization of this activity is needed, and it may require additional staff, contractor, or other resources.

### IETF Meeting Revenues

2. **Requirement**: Meeting revenues are another important source of funding
    that supports the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid by IETF meeting
    participants. The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in
    consultation with other IETF LLC staff and the IETF community, with approval
    by the IETF LLC Board. Setting these fees and projecting the number of
    participants at future meetings is a key part of the annual budget process.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track with Caveat

    **Comments**: Since 2020, driven by the COVID pandemic, more people have remotely participated in IETF meetings and to provide a good experience, the IETF has invested in technical tools to provide a good experience for those participants. The IETF LLC has adjusted in-person registration fees and introduced remote participation fees in order to maintain a consistent level of funding that partly covers the cost of meetings and associates costs (such as the Secretariat). Registration income is still down from pre-COVID times and continues to fluctuate but the underlyng trend is one of improvement.

   At the same time, the employers of some IETF participants have sought to control or reduce travel-related expenses for meetings, and there are an increasing number of self-funded, grant-funded and not-for-profit-funded participants who have the same aim. This has prompted a range of questions about the IETF's approach to meetings, including the cost of where we meet, how to maximize the benefits when we do meet, what form of funding support the IETF can provide to IETF participants, and whether the three meeting per year cadence remains the best operating model for the IETF. These issues must be addressed, if at all, by the IESG; the IETF LLC would then operationalize any change in approach to the conduct of meetings. The IESG may therefore wish to conduct a community assessment to determine whether any future changes are appropriate. 

### IETF Technical Tools

3. **Requirement**: Improve the IETF's Technical Environment. Undertake changes
    to better enable technical contributors to focus more on that technical work
    and less on administrative work or support activities.  This could for
    example mean directing more financial resources towards the creation of new
    or improvement of existing tools, which might be produced by contractors
    rather than solely by volunteers.  As a result, volunteers could instead
    focus on developing the standards themselves.  Thus, if the core competency
    of IETF attendees and their reason for participating in the IETF is to
    develop standards, then create an environment where they can focus
    exclusively on that activity and delegate to contractors, staff, or other
    resources the responsibility for creating and maintaining tools and
    processes to support this activity.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; In Progress

    **Comments:** This remains a key focus for the LLC, as there continues to be
    technical debt that needs to be addressed, and the IETF wishes to move
    towards more modern software architecture, systems architecture, software
    development practices and user-centered design. Currently there are two
    major elements to the work. The first is implementing the new IT services
    infrastructure strategy that was agreed with the community after 
    consultation. This involves separating out services, moving them into the
    cloud and through significantlu enhanced instrumentation, tuning their 
    performance to match community expectations.  The second element is rewriting
    the many applications used by the community to provide more features, modern
    UIs, better performance and a consistent architecture, addressing the many 
    issues raised by the community over the years.
    
    Resourcing is no longer alimiting factor and the LLC has invested in three 
    further senior developers since the last review. This step was not taken 
    lightly and only committed too when very few bids were received in response
    to our RFPs for software development services. 

    With the growth of the internal team and the rapid progress in some areas, 
    greater care is now being taken to check with the community that the LLC is
    delivering the changes that the community has prioritized.

## D. Other Gaps

### RPC, ISE, Trust

What do we wish to say here?

### IETF Trust

Prior to the IASA2 changes, the IAOC members and the trustees of the IETF Trust were the same people, with executive support provided by the same person, the then IAD (IETF Administrative Director). AS a result of IASA2 there is now a separation at the governance level as the trustees and LLC board members have no cross-over, and at the executive support level as the IETF Executive Director works solely for the LLC and does not support the IETF Trust. Over time, the two organizations' operational approaches have signficantly diverged but it is not clear if this was an expected outcome of the IASA2 process.

A key reason for this divergence is that the LLC, as the more recent of the two organizations to be created by the community, was given a clear and detailed set of community requirements in BCP 101 for how it should operate. These include a set of principles for it to follow, such as significant transparency and strong community responsiveness, and a requirement for an extensive set of governance policies created through community consultation, which it is had had in place since soon after inception. 

The community may wish to consider structural options for closing the gap between the organizations and consider if a similar set of community requirements would be appropriate for the IETF Trust, particularly as it completes its transformation from a trust to a corporation with similar legal obligations as the LLC.

### IETF Secretariat

Prior to the IASA2 changes, when the only IETF staffer was the then IAD, the outsourced IETF Secretariat worked directly for the community in certain places/processes as specified in RFCs. RFC 8717, one of the IASA2 outputs, partially maintained this by creating the new role of "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" and updated a number of RFCs that included the old concept of "Executive Director" to now refer to that MD role.  Separately, RFC 8711, which created the IETF LLC and the IETF Executive Director role, put the IETF LLC and IETF Executive Director in charge of all contractors and their work, including the IETF Secretariat.  

With the implementation of IASA2, the dynamic around administrative support changed in two key ways. The first of these was the development of a broad leadership role for the IETF Executive Director driven both by community expectations, and the needs of the IETF Secretariat. The second was the switch for processes that were defined as being handled by a particular individual, to being delivered by a team, generally involving both the Secretariat and the LLC and often supported by new tools. There is no longer a clear boundary between the IETF LLC and the IETF Secretariat for much of the operational support of the IETF.

The IETF LLC proposes to address this with a new RFC that replaces references to the IETF Secretariat with the more generic term 'IASA' and removes any references to individual administrative support roles that do not require a nominated indivdual to deliver them.

### Community Comments 

The IETF LLC also asked an open-ended question of the IETF community, seeking
suggestions on any additional administrative, financial, legal, or operational
gaps; areas of improvement; and any areas of under-specification or
over-specification in IASA2 documents that the IETF LLC Board, IETF Secretariat,
IETF Executive Director, or the IETF community perceive that have not already
been addressed in prior sections of this document. No comments were received in
this area that have not already been addressed in prior sections of this
document.

The IETF community have provided the following feedback: TBD based on comments.

## E. Future IASA2 Retrospective Reports

Continue performing a regular assessment of the IASA structure and IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final IETF meeting of each of those years. The next IASA assessments should occur in 2027, 2030, 2033, and so on.
