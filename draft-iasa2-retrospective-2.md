# Second IASA2 Retrospective

## Reason for This Document

BCP 101 / RFC 8711 specifies a requirement to conduct a [three-year retrospective](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-three-year-assessment) of the IETF Administrative Support Activity version 2.0 (IASA2). That was completed in 2021 (https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf), and the first recommendation in that report was that additional retrospectives should occur every three years (see below). 

This is the second IASA2 retrospective, and future retrospectives should be published in 2027, 2030, 2033, and so on every three years. 

> The IETF LLC should conduct a regular assessment of the IASA structure and
   IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final
   IETF meeting of each of those years. Based on this IASA2 retrospective being
   completed in 2021, the next IASA assessments should occur in 2024, 2027,
   2030, 2033, and so on.
> 
> The point of performing a regular assessment is that the IETF's way of
   working and its needs will continue to evolve, while the external environment
   will also change. Thus, periodically checking in to see whether there are
   structural, process, financial, operational, legal, or other administrative
   adaptations are needed makes sense. As well, by making small changes on an
   incremental basis, the risks associated with each change is likely to be
   smaller because the changes are correspondingly smaller, and there is a
   regular check-in every three years at which point the IETF can assess the
   effectiveness of any change so that modest course corrections can be made.
   Finally, keeping up with internal and external changes may also potentially
   help the IETF avoid large once-a-decade administrative structure changes that
   are multi-year efforts like IASA2 - and this is not only a time-saver but
   also lets IETF leaders and participants remain more focused on the core
   standards work of the IETF.
> 
> In addition, as the IETF evolves how the organization wishes to work and meet
   in a post-COVID world, such as potentially changing meeting frequency,
   reducing in-person venue size requirements, shifting to hybrid meetings, and
   so on, the IETF LLC will need to adapt to provide the necessary
   administrative, operational, legal, financial, and other support to meet the
   changing needs of the IETF.

# Note on Form 

In the first IASA2 retrospective, we reviewed a list of 62 requirements. Most of those were met, so in order to reduce the length of this document and focus on what has changed since 2021, we will not reproduce the full list here. The original IASA2 retrospective is available at [https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf).

# Review of Key Issues, Requirements and Responsibilities

## Sponsorships and Donations to the IETF LLC

1.A. **Requirement:** Fundraising. The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.

1.B. **Requirement**: Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of the financial support for the IETF. Within the general bounds noted in Section 7.8, the IETF LLC is responsible for fundraising activities in order to establish, maintain, and grow a strong foundation of donation revenues. This can and does include both direct financial contributions as well as in-kind contributions, such as equipment, software licenses, and services.

Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey to sponsors and donors any special oversight or direct influence over the IETF's technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC. This helps ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from whom funds are raised, and so helps to maintain an open and consensus-based IETF standards process.

To the extent that the IETF LLC undertakes any significant special projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC may need to fund-raise specifically for those special projects. If this situation arises, the  IETF LLC will continue to conduct fundraising specifically to support the IETF as required, in addition to undertaking new fundraising efforts for special projects. All fundraising efforts and proceeds will be accounted for under the appropriate financial standards, with a clear separation of accounts aligned with the purpose and policies of the monies and the projects for which the funds are raised. Fundraising for special projects will not conflict with the primary requirement of the IETF LLC to focus on fundraising for the sustainability and continued success of the IETF.   


1.C. **Requirement**: Support a Re-Envisioned Funding Model: Provide the staff
    support and resources needed to adapt the funding model of the IETF to
    changes in the industry, participation, and expenses.  The structure should
    also allow for and be able to support new funding streams or changes to the
    proportion of funds from various Sources.

**Status:** &#x1F7E1; In Progress

   **Comments:** This remains a primary focus of the IETF LLC. 
   
   Sponsorship income has been good and has grown with our modernisation of our sponsorship offerings, but is at risk as some traditional IETF sponsor companies reduce their standards-related spending. Sponsorship income in 2018 was $X and by 2023 had increase YY% to $Y. A number of [new programs](https://www.ietf.org/support-us/sponsorship/) for sponsors have been introduced in order to attract more funding, such as Diversity & Inclusion, Running Code and Sustainability.
   
   Donations to the IETF Endowment have in contrast been disappointing. As a result, the IETF LLC eliminated a staff role and redesigned its fundraising approach to be sector-specific and targeted rather than general. Board attention on and prioritization of this activity should continue to be high. It may require additional staff, contractor, or other resources to reach its full potential.

### IETF Meeting Revenues

2. **Requirement**: Meeting revenues are another important source of funding
    that supports the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid by IETF meeting
    participants. The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in
    consultation with other IETF LLC staff and the IETF community, with approval
    by the IETF LLC Board. Setting these fees and projecting the number of
    participants at future meetings are a key part of the annual budget process.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; In Progress

    **Comments**: Since 2020, driven by the COVID pandemic, more people have remotely participated in IETF meetings and to provide a good experience, the IETF has invested in technical tools to provide a good experience for those participants. The IETF LLC has adjusted in-person registration fees and introduced remote participation fees in order to maintain a consistent level of funding that partly covers the cost of meetings and associated costs (such as the Secretariat). Registration income is still down from pre-COVID times and continues to fluctuate but the underlying trend is one of improvement.

   At the same time, the employers of some IETF participants have sought to control or reduce travel-related expenses for meetings, and there are an increasing number of self-funded, grant-funded and not-for-profit-funded participants who have the same aim. This has prompted a range of questions about the IETF's approach to meetings, including the cost of where we meet, how to maximize the benefits when we do meet, what form of funding support the IETF can provide to IETF participants, and whether the three meeting per year cadence remains the best operating model for the IETF. These issues must be addressed, if at all, by the IESG; the IETF LLC would then operationalize any change in approach to the conduct of meetings. The IESG may therefore wish to conduct a community assessment to determine whether any future changes are appropriate. 

### IETF Technical Tools

3. **Requirement**: Improve the IETF's Technical Environment. Undertake changes
    to better enable technical contributors to focus more on that technical work
    and less on administrative work or support activities.  This could for
    example mean directing more financial resources towards the creation of new
    or improvement of existing tools, which might be produced by contractors
    rather than solely by volunteers.  As a result, volunteers could instead
    focus on developing the standards themselves.  Thus, if the core competency
    of IETF attendees and their reason for participating in the IETF is to
    develop standards, then create an environment where they can focus
    exclusively on that activity and delegate to contractors, staff, or other
    resources the responsibility for creating and maintaining tools and
    processes to support this activity.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; Ongoing / Major Improvement

    **Comments:** This remains a key focus for the IETF LLC, as there continues to be
    technical debt that needs to be addressed, and the IETF wishes to move
    towards more modern software architecture, systems architecture, software
    development practices and user-centered design. Currently there are two
    major elements to the work. The first is implementing the new IT services
    infrastructure strategy that was agreed with the community after 
    consultation. This involves separating out services, moving them into the
    cloud and through significantly enhanced instrumentation, tuning their 
    performance to match community expectations.  The second element is rewriting
    the many applications used by the community to provide more features, modern
    UIs, better performance and a consistent architecture, addressing the many 
    issues raised by the community over the years.
    
    Resourcing is no longer a limiting factor and the IETF LLC has invested in three 
    further senior developers since the last review. This step was not taken 
    lightly and only committed to when very few bids were received in response
    to our RFPs for software development services. 

    With the growth of the internal team and the rapid progress in some areas, 
    greater care is now being taken to check with the community that the LLC is
    delivering the changes that the community has prioritized.

## D. Other Gaps

### Ombusteam

After the IETF LLC was formed, [RFC 7776](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7776) was updated in [RFC 8716 / BCP 25](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8716). However, no other substantive changes in the operation or oversight of the Ombudsteam were made; the name of the IAOC function was simply updated to the IETF LLC. Since that time, the IETF LLC has identified some issues of concern that need to be addressed by the IETF as a whole. 

The IETF LLC Board is responsible for assuring the long term financial solvency of the IETF and safeguarding it from a variety of risks. These responsibilities give the IETF LLC a fiduciary and legal responsibility.

The Ombudsteam is a critical function for the IETF to mitigate the risk of harassment in the IETF.  The IETF LLC Board has identified two concerns that should be addressed by the IETF community.

First, the work of the Ombudsteam function can have significant legal implications for the IETF (e.g., harassment, assault). However, under the current operating practices defined in RFC 7776, the IETF LLC Board does not have any visibility into those possible legal implications and is therefore unable to properly implement risk management procedures.

Second, the IETF LLC Board also observes that for the Ombudsteam to credibly perform its function, it requires the confidence of the community.  The current confidentiality procedures derived from RFC 7776  prevent the community from having even the most basic insight into whether the Ombudsteam is functioning.  The IETF LLC Board believes that the community would benefit from additional transparency, as [other organizations have demonstrated](https://ombuds.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2022-23-JHU-Ombuds-Office-Annual-Report.pdf).  We believe an annual transparency report should be required of the Ombudsteam function at the IETF. 

We recommend and will initiate a community proceeding to update RFCs pertaining to the Ombudsteam function.

### RFC Production Center (RPC)

The [RFC Production Center](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/) (RPC) edits documents and creates Requests for Comment (RFC). Publishing RFCs is the output of the IETF standards process (and similar processes), and as such is a critical productivity metric for the IETF LLC in operating the IETF. These are metrics such as the volume of RFCs published over time and how long it takes the RPC to edit and publish RFCs once they have entered their work queue. 

For quite some time, the RPC has not met the Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets established by the IETF. One reason can be attributed to the age and complexity of the publishing tools used by the RPC, most of which are several decades old. Another might be attributable to how the internal work processes of the RPC are quantitatively measured and incrementally improved over time. It is also notable that the changes introduced by [XMLv3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7991) have not shown a meaningful improvement for RPC output. 

As a result, the IETF LLC needs to provide additional operational direction to the RPC, establish internal workflow metrics, and make significant improvements to the technical tools used by the RPC to perform their work. This will likely have upstream effects over document publishing tools, which should become easier to use and ensure that the RPC is provided with consistently high quality document input. 

The IETF LLC expects to announce steps being taken in this area soon. For the next retrospective in 2027, the community should expect significant improvements to have been made in the RPC.  

### Independent Submission Editor (ISE)

The IETF LLC also maintains the [Independent Submission Editor](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8730) (ISE) function, which offers an alternative publishing pathway that can publish RFCs that do not originate from IETF Working Groups. The [ISE function](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/ise/) is oveseen by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and has its own oversight board. That board currently includes fifteen people (notably several times the size of the IETF LLC board) and published eleven RFCs in 2023.

The job of the IETF LLC is to support the IETF's standards process, of which the ISE and IAB are a part. It is not the IETF LLC's role to set the structure of any potential ISE function per se. However, the IETF LLC is responsible for operating these functions, such as the RPC and observes that complexity is cost. Reducing or controlling key costs at the IETF can reduce the need for meeting fee increases in the future. 

Thus, the IETF LLC wishes to note that there may be an opportunity for the IETF to simplify its approach to publishing RFCs by consolidating all of this work into the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), which will likely help contain the cost of the RPC function. 

Ultimately this is more a matter for the IETF community to take up, specifically the IESG and IAB.  

### IETF Trust

Prior to the IASA2 changes, the IAOC members and the trustees of the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) were the same people, with executive support provided by the same person, the then IAD (IETF Administrative Director). Under IASA2, the people managing the IETF Trust became different people from those managing the IETF (the IETF LLC). This has had knock-on effects that the IETF comminity may not fully recognize. 

As a result of IASA2 there is now a separation at the governance level as the trustees of the IETF Trust and IETF LLC board members. There is no cross-over or personnel or formally designated liaison. In addition, at the executive support level there is also separation, as the IETF Executive Director works solely for the IETF LLC and does not operate the IETF Trust or act as an executive for the IETF Trust. Over time, the two organizations' operational approaches have  diverged but it is not clear if this was an expected outcome of the IASA2 process.

Despite this divergence, it seems clear that the IETF Trust solely exists due to and in the service of the IETF. Not only is IETF in the name of the IETF Trust, but the IETF Trust's website is within the IETF's ietf.org domain, the IETF Nominating Committee selects trustees, and the IETF Trust notes their purupose is "acquiring, holding, maintaining and licensing certain existing and future intellectual property and other property used in connection with the Internet standards process and its administration..." The IETF, and thus by extension the IETF LLC as the legal home of the IETF, is thus the sole beneficiary of the IETF Trust.

The key reason for this divergence is that the IETF LLC, as the more recent of the two organizations to be created by the community, was given a clear and detailed set of community requirements in BCP 101 for how it should operate. These include a set of principles for it to follow, such as significant transparency and strong community responsiveness, and a requirement for an extensive set of governance policies created through community consultation, which it had in place since soon after inception. 

The community may wish to consider discussing potential structural options for closing the gap between the IETF LLC and IETF Trust, and consider whether a similar set of community requirements would be appropriate for the IETF Trust - particularly as it completes its transformation from a trust to a corporation with similar legal obligations as the IETF LLC. 

### IETF Secretariat - Managing Director Role

Prior to the IASA2 changes, the only IETF staffer was the then IAD. The outsourced IETF Secretariat worked directly for the community in certain places/processes as specified in RFCs. RFC 8717, one of the IASA2 outputs, partially maintained this by creating the new role of "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MD) and updated a number of RFCs that included the old concept of "Executive Director" to now refer to that MD role.  Separately, RFC 8711, which created the IETF LLC and the IETF Executive Director role, put the IETF LLC and IETF Executive Director in charge of all contractors and their work, including the IETF Secretariat.  

With the implementation of IASA2, the dynamic around administrative support changed in two key ways. The first of these was the development of a broad leadership role for the IETF Executive Director driven both by community expectations, and the needs of the IETF Secretariat. The second was the switch for processes that were defined as being handled by a particular individual, to being delivered by a team, generally involving both the Secretariat and the LLC and often supported by new tools. There is no longer a clear boundary between the IETF LLC and the IETF Secretariat for much of the operational support of the IETF - which is a positive outcome of IASA2. This would appear to obviate the need for a special Managing Director role.

The IETF LLC proposes to address this with a new RFC that replaces references to the IETF Secretariat with the more generic term 'IASA' and removes any references to individual administrative support roles that do not require a nominated indivdual to deliver them.

### Realistically Describing IETF Functions

The IETF LLC has observed over time that there is sometimes difficulty within the IETF community in understanding the true legal structure and operation of the IETF. This can sometimes be seen via the expression within the IETF community of some informal views that certain functions or parts of the IETF are totally independent of the IETF. This is not in fact the case, and it can hinder a clear understanding and discussion of critical IETF matters and decisions about the future of the IETF. 

The IETF LLC is the legal and financial home of the IETF; there are no other legal entities. Within this IETF structure there is also the IAB, IESG, IRTF, RSE, RPC, IETF Trust, and so on. None of those organizations are legally independent of the IETF; they are core functions of the IETF.

### Community Comments 

The IETF LLC also asked an open-ended question of the IETF community, seeking
suggestions on any additional administrative, financial, legal, or operational
gaps; areas of improvement; and any areas of under-specification or
over-specification in IASA2 documents that the IETF LLC Board, IETF Secretariat,
IETF Executive Director, or the IETF community perceive that have not already
been addressed in prior sections of this document. No comments were received in
this area that have not already been addressed in prior sections of this
document.

The IETF community have provided the following feedback: TBD based on comments.

## E. Future IASA2 Retrospective Reports

Continue performing a regular assessment of the IASA structure and IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final IETF meeting of each of those years. The next IASA assessments should occur in 2027, 2030, 2033, and so on.
