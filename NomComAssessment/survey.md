# Survey Draft

Title: Survey on the IETF LLC and IETF Trust Nominating Process

The IETF LLC is conducting this survey ahead of [IETF-122](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/122/) in March 2025. The objective is, following a suggestion in a [recent retrospective](https://www.ietf.org/blog/iasa2-retrospective-second-report/), to collect the views of those that have been a part of the nominating process for board positions in the IETF LLC and IETF Trust. In particular we are hoping to better understand whether the current IETF Nominating Committee is the best way to select these non-technical positions and, if not optimal, to begin an informed conversation at the upcoming IETF about what this is the case and potentially what to do instead. 

Thank you in advance for completing this survey!
