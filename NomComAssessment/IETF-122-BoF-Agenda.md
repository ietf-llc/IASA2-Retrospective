# Name: Alternative Nomination Approaches for the IETF LLC & IETF Trust
## Description 
The IETF has completed the second IASA2 retrospective. The first IASA2 retrospective (see pages 9 - 10) highlighted a concern over the
suitability of the IETF NomCom for selecting IETF LLC board members. As of the second IASA2 retrospective (18 Dec 2024), this concern
remains and should be addressed by scheduling a BoF at a future IETF meeting to
discuss the issue and identify potential alternatives, such as a new nominating
committee solely focused on the selection of board members for the IETF LLC and IETF
Trust. Such a new committee might be comprised from a pool of prior IETF LLC and
IETF Trust/IETF Intellectual Property Management board members, prior IETF chairs,
etc. and would need to include a means to include IETF community directional input
equivalent to what is provided by the current IETF NomCom.

This BoF is intended to explain the problem to be potentially solved and discuss potential alternative structures.
