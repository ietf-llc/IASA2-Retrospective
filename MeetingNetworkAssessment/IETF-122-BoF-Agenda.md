# Name: Future IETF Meeting Network Requirements
## Description 
The IETF has completed the second IASA2 retrospective. That report contained an action item on this, and this BoF is intended to take the next step on that.

Operating the network to support an IETF meeting is a significant undertaking and is
at the core of people's meeting experience. Today, we rely on some contractors to
lead the deployment and operation of the network, supported by volunteers from the
IETF community. There are a range of costs that are associated with the meeting
network, some of which may be related to supporting things that the community does
not want or need. Alternatively, there may be things the network does not provide
that the community would like to add.

It seems like this is a good opportunity to convene a BoF session to discuss the
community's future expectations for the meeting network. These expectations can
then be used to create technical requirements that the IETF meeting network team can
consider for future meetings.
